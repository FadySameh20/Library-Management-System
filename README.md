### Getting Started

1) Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FadySameh20/Library-Management-System.git
    cd Library-Management-System
    ```

2) Create your environment file
    - Copy the example file and adjust values as needed:
        ```bash
        # macOS/Linux
        cp .env.example .env

        # Windows PowerShell
        Copy-Item .env.example .env
        ```

    - Set the values of the environment variables
        - `POSTGRES_DB`: Database name
        - `POSTGRES_USER`: Database name
        - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Database name
        - `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string for Prisma **(already set, no changes needed)**

3) Start the docker container with docker compose
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```

    This will the run `entrypoint.sh` file, which performs the following:
      - Generates Prisma client.
      - Run database migrations.
      - Run tests.
      - Start the backend application.

4) The backend will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
    - API docs **(Swagger UI)**: [http://localhost:3000/api-docs](http://localhost:3000/api-docs)
  
### Database Schema Diagram
  On starting the docker container, Prisma will run the migrations automatically.
